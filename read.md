# CI/CD with Azure Pipelines and GitHub

> Streamline your DevOps process in this four-part webinar series

This online series is for teams looking to implement continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). You will learn how to collaborate with others using Azure Pipelines, GitHub, and Azure Artifacts. You’ll get expert guidance to get quickly up to speed with practical, hands-on exercises. Azure Pipelines is a service you can use to automatically build and test your code project and make it available to other users. It has cloud-hosted agents for Linux, macOS, and Windows; powerful workflows with native container support; and flexible deployments to Kubernetes, VMs, and serverless environments. We’ll show GitHub users how to get fast, reliable builds through integration with GitHub pull requests, checks, and statuses. For fully integrated package management, you’ll get hands-on experience with Azure Artifacts so you can create and share Maven, npm, and NuGet package feeds from public and private sources.

In addition to Q&A with Microsoft experts during the live broadcasts, our team will be available for assistance while you're working through the exercises on your own time.
